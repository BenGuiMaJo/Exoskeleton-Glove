# Exoskeleton-Glove
An exoskeleton hand connected to an Arduino glove

  What is that?

Throughout this project, we want to demonstrate that a robotic hand is able to reproduce the movements of a human hand. Thus, our glove collects and sends data thanks to a Xbee module and the Arduino card. The arduino card, put on the robotic hand, gets this data and, depending on what it receives, activates the servomotors. Their job is to bend the fingers as much as the real hand does. At the same time, on the connected glove, LEDs are lit up accordingly to the movement.

  Documents at your disposal:
  
Most of the information is available in our report named "Exoskeleton Glove Rapport". For a quick comprehension of our project, I advise you to check the presentations we have made. You'll find them in the "Diapo" folder. Also, each of us have written about our personnal experience throughout the whole project. These files are located in the "Doc" folder.

  Enjoy!
